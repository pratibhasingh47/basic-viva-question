## Question 1 -> What is C++ ? What are the advantages of C++ ?

**C++** is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented, and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platforms like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc. But there are the benefits and drawbacks of C++ on the idea of which they will start their new journey of programming. It is one of the oldest and most effective languages that also continues to dominate the realm of programming.

***Advantages of C++:***

* C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It may be a collection of commands, which tell the pc to try to do “something.” This collection of commands is typically called C++ ASCII text files.

* C++ could also be a problem-oriented language that’s much easier to use than the other low-level languages like binary coding. It takes much more space than low-level languages but it’s much easier to understand and learn.

* C++ program has many advantages when it involves programming, All C++ program stand-alone files must use the foremost function to allow the program to start out up and motivate its functions.

* C++ program can support unions and structures that are a mix of stand-alone and put-together files, It uses the standard C++ application mentioned as “.cpp”, C++ uses the reserved library word mentioned as “goto” that’s the same as Java’s continue, or break commands.

* The global data and global functions are used within C++ that aren’t utilized in many other high-level languages within the pc sciences and it is an advantage to the programming languages.

* As C++ doesn’t use the objects, it’s difficult to make the programs that have inheritance data and thus the reformed the programs to contribute to the other data and therefore the programs, it is possible to undertake to the present, however, but is difficult, These inheritance data and programs are mentioned because of the inheritance trees.

* C++ doesn’t support class methods that are faithful away, but class methods are basically functions, and sometimes they’re referred to as functions.

* C++ program uses multi-paradigm programming, Paradigm means the planning of programming, paradigm concerned about the logic, the structure, and procedure of program, C++ program is multi-paradigm means it follows three paradigms Generic, Imperative, Object-Oriented.

* C++ program is useful for low-level programming language and really efficient for general purposes, It offers performance and memory efficiently, It offers high-level abstraction, within the language of the matter domain

* C++ may be a system programming and features a relatively clear and mature standard,

* C++ program supports inline function, C++ supports exception handling, it’s pointer and references, C++ uses cin and cout.

* C++ has a large and mature ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that can be used to accelerate development and simplify tasks like network programming, graphics rendering, and database access.

## Question 2 -> What are the different data types present in C++? 

####  **Data Types in C++ are Mainly Divided into 3 Types:**

***1. Primitive Data Types***: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 
* Integer
* Character
* Boolean
* Floating Point
* Double Floating Point
* Valueless or Void
* Wide Character

***2. Derived Data Types***: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 
* Function
* Array
* Pointer
* Reference

***3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types***: Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:  
* Class
* Structure
* Union
* Enumeration
* Typedef defined Datatype

## Question 3 -> What are references in C++ ?

When a variable is declared as a reference, it becomes an alternative name for an existing variable. A variable can be declared as a reference by putting ‘&’ in the declaration. 

Also, we can define a reference variable as a type of variable that can act as a reference to another variable. ‘&’ is used for signifying the address of a variable or any memory. Variables associated with reference variables can be accessed either by its name or by the reference variable associated with it.

***Syntax:*** 
```
data_type &ref = variable;
```

## Question 4 -> Define token in C++. 

We have several types of tokens each of which serves a specific purpose in the syntax and semantics of C++. Below are the main types of tokens in C++:

* Identifiers
* Keywords
* Constants
* Strings
* Special Symbols
* Operators

## Question 5 -> What do you mean by Call by Value and Call by Reference ? 

We have several types of tokens each of which serves a specific purpose in the syntax and semantics of C++. Below are the main types of tokens in C++:

* Identifiers
* Keywords
* Constants
* Strings
* Special Symbols
* Operators
