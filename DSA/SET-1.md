## Question 1 -> What is Data Structure ?

Data structures are essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations.
Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs , each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem. Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance.

## Question 2 -> What are linear and non-linear data Structures ?

***Linear Data Structures***: These structures store data in a sequential order this allowing for easy insertion and deletion operations. Examples include arrays, linked lists, and queues.

***Non-Linear Data Structures***: These structures store data in a hierarchical or interconnected manner this allowing for more complex relationships between data elements. Examples include trees, graphs, and hash tables.

## Question 3 -> What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures ?

**Operations on different Data Structure:-**

~ ***Traversing***: Traversing a Data Structure means to visit the element stored in it. It visits data in a systematic manner. This can be done with any type of DS. 
Below is the program to illustrate traversal in an array, stack, queue and linkedlist.

~ ***Searching***: Searching means to find a particular element in the given data-structure. It is considered as successful when the required element is found. Searching is the operation which we can performed on data-structures like array, linked-list, tree, graph, etc.

~ ***Insertion***: It is the operation which we apply on all the data-structures. Insertion means to add an element in the given data structure. The operation of insertion is successful when the required element is added to the required data-structure. It is unsuccessful in some cases when the size of the data structure is full and when there is no space in the data-structure to add any additional element. The insertion has the same name as an insertion in the data-structure as an array, linked-list, graph, tree. In stack, this operation is called Push. In the queue, this operation is called Enqueue.

~ ***Deletion***: It is the operation which we apply on all the data-structures. Deletion means to delete an element in the given data structure. The operation of deletion is successful when the required element is deleted from the data structure. The deletion has the same name as a deletion in the data-structure as an array, linked-list, graph, tree, etc. In stack, this operation is called Pop. In Queue this operation is called Dequeue.

## Question 4 -> How is an Array different from Linked List ?

Array: Arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, resulting in easily calculable addresses for the elements stored and this allows faster access to an element at a specific index.

Linked List: Linked lists are less rigid in their storage structure and elements are usually not stored in contiguous locations, hence they need to be stored with additional tags giving a reference to the next element.
