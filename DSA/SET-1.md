### Question 1 -> What is Data Structure ?

Data structures are essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations.
Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs , each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem. Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance.
