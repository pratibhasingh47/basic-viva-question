## Question 1 -> What is Data Structure ?

Data structures are essential components that help organize and store data efficiently in computer memory. They provide a way to manage and manipulate data effectively, enabling faster access, insertion, and deletion operations.
Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs , each serving specific purposes based on the requirements of the problem. Understanding data structures is fundamental for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing software performance.

## Question 2 -> What are linear and non-linear data Structures?  ?

***Linear Data Structures***: These structures store data in a sequential order this allowing for easy insertion and deletion operations. Examples include arrays, linked lists, and queues.

***Non-Linear Data Structures***: These structures store data in a hierarchical or interconnected manner this allowing for more complex relationships between data elements. Examples include trees, graphs, and hash tables.
